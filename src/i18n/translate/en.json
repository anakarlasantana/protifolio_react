I fondly remember the time when I became addicted to learning Illustrator and Photoshop. I created logos, created layouts, made business and wedding cards, edited photos and even produced banner art for my colleagues, all because it gave me immense pleasure. Nowadays, I realize that not everyone has this facility with technology. Spending hours in front of a monitor creating is actually a legitimate profession. I've always been passionate about technology, even when I didn't believe in myself. Therefore, today I am reevaluating my path and focusing my energies on my professional development as a fullstack developer, focusing on JavaScript, but always open to learning new technologies. The fun continues! ðŸ˜‰ðŸš€",
